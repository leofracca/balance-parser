# balance-parser

Script to parse reports generated by [Ivy Wallet](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet) and generate reports to upload on [SankeyMATIC](https://sankeymatic.com/) to visualize revenues and expenses.

The generated output is in the following format:

> Income1 [1234.56] Revenues
> Income2 [789.12] Revenues
> IncomeN [34567.89] Revenues
> 
> Revenues [9876.54] Expense1
> Revenues [321.01] Expense2
> Revenues [2345.67] ExpenseN

Then it is possible to paste the output on SankeyMATIC to create a graph to visualize the result.
